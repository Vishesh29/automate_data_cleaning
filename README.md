## Introduction
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, often consuming significant time and resources. Automating this process enhances efficiency and ensures consistency across datasets. This project provides a structured approach to fully automate data cleaning using Python.

## Steps to Automate Data Cleaning
### 1. Run Basic Data Quality Checks
The first step is to assess the dataset for missing values, duplicate entries, and inefficient memory usage. This helps identify key issues that need to be addressed in subsequent steps.

### 2. Standardize Data Types
Ensuring uniform data types across the dataset prevents errors in analysis. This includes converting date strings into proper date formats, handling numerical values stored as text, and standardizing categorical variables.

### 3. Handle Missing Values
Missing data can introduce bias into the analysis. This step involves replacing missing values using appropriate strategies such as median imputation for numerical data and mode imputation for categorical data.

### 4. Detect and Handle Outliers
Outliers can distort statistical summaries and predictive models. The dataset is examined to identify extreme values, and techniques such as capping or removal are applied to maintain data integrity.

### 5. Validate the Results
After the cleaning process, the dataset is re-evaluated to ensure all issues have been resolved. A final check confirms that missing values are handled, duplicates are removed, and data types are standardized.

## Usage
To use this automated data cleaning pipeline:

- Load your dataset into a Python environment.
- Perform initial data quality checks.
- Apply standardization techniques for data types.
- Handle missing values and detect outliers.
- Validate the cleaned dataset before further processing.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```
